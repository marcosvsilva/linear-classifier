# Linear classifier

This repository contains a simple implementation of a linear classification machine learning model. Linear classifiers are widely used for tasks such as binary classification, where the goal is to separate data points into two distinct classes.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

1. **Code**: The implementation of the linear classification model in [Python](https://www.python.org/). The code is organized into easy-to-understand sections and is well-documented to help you understand and use the model.

3. **Usage**: Instructions on how to use the code to train and evaluate the linear classification model. Make sure to follow these instructions to get the best results from the model.

4. **Dependencies**: A list of dependencies and packages required to run the code. Be sure to have these installed before using the model.

## Getting Started

To get started with this linear classification model, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/marcosvsilva/linear-classifier.git
